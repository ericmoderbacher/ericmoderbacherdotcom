Welcome to the repo for my personal website.

## Structure
I use my webBoilerPlate repo which makes it easier for me to reuse my web toolbox
You can check out its documentation which should totally exist soon ðŸ˜‰.



## Build Instructions
Yes, we build this site because compilers are our friends.


### Design Language
- Self-Documenting
- Clean but feature-rich
- Easy for others to copy
- C++, Lua, HIP/CUDA, and OpenSCAD are my favorite languages, so they will be used
- No need to leave the site, while always making it easy to do so
- I kinda love Markdown... maybe I should have a slightly modified version for my site?
