I purchased a listing of "hp 10706A Plane Mirror Interferometer 10789A Receiver 10703A Retroreflector"

the price was 185.00 (213.28 shipped) for all 3 plus a stand, and a nameless beam splitter, which seemed pretty good compared to similar listings.

This file will be the starting point for my notes and research on these items and the supporting equipment i will need to use them.
