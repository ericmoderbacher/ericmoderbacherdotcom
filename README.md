Welcome to the repo for my personal website.

## Build Instructions
Yes we build this site because compilers are our friends.


### Design Language
- Self Documenting
- clean but feature rich
- easy for others to copy
- C++, Lua, HIP/CUDA, openscad should be prominent because I dont like HTML/CSS/javascript as much as I respect them.
- No need to leave the site, while always making it easy to.
- I kind of love markdown... maybe i should have a slightly modified version for my site?

### Website Feature Wishlist
- Basic contact info, personal introduction, resume, social media
- Project Web Log / notes
- git front end like gitlab
- photo gallery
- Secure front end to my web connected capabilities:
  - Media server
  - IoT management including homekit, 3d printing, etc
  - web work space for software (in a pinch)
- my youtube-like videos
- links to validation farm, opensourceAF, friends sites
- device dark mode detection
