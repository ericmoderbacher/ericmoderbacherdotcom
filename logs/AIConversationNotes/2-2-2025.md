## Model(s) Used:
GPT-4o

## Objective
Evaluate and set up workflows for deployment, testing, and status checking in GitHub Actions. Explore options to adapt workflows for a non-Node.js project and align them with project-specific requirements.

## Discussion Summary

### 1. Workflows Overview
- After evaluating different setups and workflows, the goal was to establish the following:
    - **Deployment Workflow**: Automate the deployment process, ensuring flexibility for both building from source and using pre-built artifacts.
    - **Testing Workflow**: Standardize the approach to building, running, and validating tests for the project.
    - **Status Checking Workflow**: Proactively monitor system health and collect relevant logs or metrics for analysis.
- The workflows were initially generic, with assumptions based on practices like those used in Node.js projects. Instead, the focus was shifted to workflows better suited for **C++/C-based builds**.

### 2. Deploy Workflow
- The deployment process considers:
    1. **Building from Source**: Using a build system like **CMake** to compile the application during the deployment workflow.
    2. **Using Pre-Built Artifacts**: Deploying binaries that are produced by earlier workflows, bypassing the need to build during deployment.
- It was decided that the deploy workflow would:
    - Use **CMake** to build the project when no pre-built artifacts are available.
    - Deploy the resulting binaries to a remote server using `scp`.
    - Optionally skip the repository checkout (`actions/checkout@v3`) step when working exclusively with pre-built artifacts, to optimize runtime.

### 3. Testing Workflow
- For testing, it was important to define a repeatable workflow that works efficiently with the project’s current tooling.
- The solution defined involves:
    - Using **CMake** to configure and build the project.
    - Running tests with **CTest**, a suitable testing framework for C++/C projects.
- Flexibility was built into the workflow to support other build systems (like `make`) or test frameworks (like Google Test or Catch2), depending on future requirements.

### 4. Status Checking Workflow
- A periodic or manually triggered status-checking workflow was developed to:
    - Monitor the system’s availability by pinging endpoints such as `/health`.
    - Gather system metrics (such as CPU usage, memory, and disk space) from a remote server via SSH.
    - Archive logs or metrics as artifacts, making them available for debugging or analysis.
- This workflow can be configured to run on a schedule or manually triggered using the `workflow_dispatch` event in GitHub Actions.

### 5. Repository Checkout in GitHub Actions
- As part of the evaluation, an important distinction between **GitHub Actions** and **GitLab CI/CD** was considered:
    - Unlike GitLab, GitHub Actions does **not automatically clone the repository** into job runners.
    - The `actions/checkout@v3` step is essential if workflows require access to the repository’s source code or scripts.
- For deployment workflows, the `actions/checkout@v3` step can be skipped if pre-built binaries or externally sourced artifacts are used, reducing runtime and improving speed.

## Outcomes

### 1. Deploy Workflow
- A deploy workflow was finalized with:
    - The ability to build the project from source using **CMake**.
    - Deployment to remote servers via `scp` with flexibility to skip repository checkout when pre-built artifacts are used.

### 2. Testing Workflow
- A standardized testing workflow was defined:
    - Builds the application with **CMake**.
    - Runs tests using **CTest**.
- The testing process can easily accommodate alternate build systems or test frameworks as needed.

### 3. Status Checking Workflow
- A status-checking workflow was developed to:
    - Monitor health endpoints and system metrics.
    - Fetch logs and archive them as artifacts for debugging purposes.
    - Allow both scheduled execution and manual triggering.

### 4. General Best Practices
- When designing workflows for GitHub Actions:
    - Include the `actions/checkout@v3` step if source code is required (e.g., for building or testing).
    - Skip the `checkout` step for workflows utilizing pre-built artifacts to save time and resources.

## Conclusion
The workflows were refined and finalized based on the evaluation of different approaches. By incorporating best practices for GitHub Actions and adapting workflows to the specific requirements of a C++/C-based project, these workflows are efficient, flexible, and tailored to the repository’s needs.
